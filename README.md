# Team Xobots

## Practices

Practices will be Thursday from 4:00-5:30 and Saturday from x:00-y:30 at Go Like the Wind.

## Getting Started

I strongly encourage everybody to play the game "Light Bot".  It is a great starting point for
programming the Mindstorm robot.  You can play for free on the following web site:
